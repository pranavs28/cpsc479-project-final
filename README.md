# CPSC 479 Final Project

Located in this repository you will find a notebook capable of finetuning a stable diffusion model for the generation of Pok√©mon based on type. The notebook features various cells that can be run to import the training dataset, fine-tune the stable diffusion algorithm, generate sample images, and produce output images with various parameters. You will also a PDF of the final project paper.
